# About Restaurant Reviews application

- **Restaurant Reviews** project has a responsive design, all of the page elements is usable and visible in any viewport, including desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. Images aren't overlap, and page elements wrap when the viewport is too small to display them side by side.
- the site is accessible, implemented special features on the site.
- also was added a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all site resources (so that any page that a user has visited is available when the user is offline).
